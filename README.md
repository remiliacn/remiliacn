### Hello World!


- 🔭 Making chat bot and web crawlers
- 👯 Steam: [祈雨](https://steamcommunity.com/id/qiyu/), Discord: Remiliacn#2333
- 🌱 Learning Golang, Spring Framework, and React

Some repos (especially those are marked as archived) are really old projects. They are all badly written or really hard to maintain with, so I basically give up on actually updating them xD.
